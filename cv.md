Created an algorithm of onboarding for students of model school and transfer it into a chatbot. The curator of the school got one more free working day a week.

On base of telegram's chatbot was running out a private shop for a manufacturer company producing casual medical dress. Conversion rate in order was in 4 times higher than on web site.
